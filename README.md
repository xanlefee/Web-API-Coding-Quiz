# Web-API-Coding-Quiz
A coding quiz featuring Web APIs


In this project, I created a code quiz demonstrating the use of Web APIs. I also utilised functions, objects and conversion methods. In this coding quiz, the timer is the score and the player can only progress in the quiz  by answering questions correctly, which adds time to the timer. If questions are answered incorrectly, the timer runs out and the quiz is over. Highscores are logged into a highscores ranking, which retrieves the scores from local storage. 

This was a complex project that I chose to break up into parts, the first being creating an object to store the questions and answers. When the start button is clicked, the questions screen appears and a for loop cycles through the questions. If the end is reached, the end screen appears and the player can submit their initials. Their high score is then logged.


Some challenges included finding a way to sort an array with both string and number values, and correctly converting the local storage to a usable object, for which I used the JSON.parse method. Overall I am happy with the results.
